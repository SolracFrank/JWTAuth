# JWTAuth

This is an example project where I'll cover some auth concepts such as JWT Tokens.

## What do I expect to do:

- Basic JWT Token management
- Refresh Token for sessions
- ASP.NET Identity
- CQRS and ONION Architecture
- Email confirmation

## History:

- **03/12/23**: Finished basic functions such as Login, Register, and Session Update (Using JWT Token and Refresh Token). Not using SOLID principles.
